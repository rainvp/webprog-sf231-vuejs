          <h2>Goals In Life</h2>
          <p>My dream is to build a successful career in a first-world country, preferably Singapore. Once I
            achieve that, I hope to eventually migrate to Canada and bring my family to live there with me. I
            believe that building a good life in the Philippines is challenging, and there are better opportunities
            to grow and expand my career in a first-world country. I want to prove to myself that I’m capable of
            achieving something great, even in a field that I’m still learning to navigate. If God blesses me with
            success here in the Philippines, I would be incredibly grateful. However, I still aim to provide for my
            family in the fastest and most effective way possible, and I believe that striving for more is the best
            path to achieving that. My ultimate goal is to create a better life not just for myself, but for the people
            I care about the most. At the same time, I want to find personal contentment—living a life where I
            feel proud of what I’ve accomplished and at peace with where I am.</p>
